# <a id='1'>1. Introduction/ Use Cases</a>
* According to Epsilon research, 80% of customers are more likely to do business with you if you provide personalized service. Banking is no exception. 
* The digitalization of everyday lives means that customers expect services to be delivered in a personalized and timely manner… and often before they´ve even realized they need the service. In their 3rd Kaggle competition, Santander Group aims to go a step beyond recognizing that there is a need to provide a customer a financial service and intends to determine the amount or value of the customer's transaction. This means anticipating customer needs in a more concrete, but also simple and personal way. With so many choices for financial services, this need is greater now than ever before
* In this competition, Santander Group is asking Kagglers to help them identify the value of transactions for each potential customer. This is a first step that Santander needs to nail in order to personalize their services at scale.
